# HEAP CommitRoutine encoded by a global key
# The HEAP handle data structure includes a function pointer field called
# CommitRoutine that is called when memory regions within the heap are committed.
# Starting with Windows Vista, this field was encoded using a random value that
# was also stored as a field in the HEAP handle data structure.

## Undertanding the LFH
#LargeBlocksIndex/BlocksIndex – This is a _HEAP_LIST_LOOKUP structure that is used for a variety of
# purposes. Due to its importance, it will be discussed in greater detail later in this
# document.
#FreeLists – A special linked-list that contains pointers to ALL of the free chunks for this
# heap. It can almost be thought of as a heap cache, but for chunks of every size (and no
# single associated bitmap).
#FrontEndHeapType – An integer is initially set to 0x0, and is subsequently assigned a
# value of 0x2, indicating the use of a LFH. Note: Windows 7 does not actually have
# support for using Lookaside Lists.
#FrontEndHeap – A pointer to the associated front-end heap. This will either be NULL or
# a pointer to a _LFH_HEAP structure when running under Windows 7.
